# 42-Cpp
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed as part of the 42 school's curriculum. Each project is designed to deepen understanding of various C++ concepts and programming paradigms.

1. **CPP Module 00**:
   - **Description**: Introduces the basics of C++ programming, covering topics such as namespaces, classes, member functions, and file handling.

2. **CPP Module 01**:
   - **Description**: Focuses on memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of the `new` and `delete` operators.

3. **CPP Module 02**:
   - **Description**: Covers ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the concept of Orthodox Canonical Form.

4. **CPP Module 03**:
   - **Description**: Delves into inheritance in C++, exploring how derived classes can extend base classes and the implications of different inheritance types.

5. **CPP Module 04**:
   - **Description**: Explores subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and the use of dynamic casting.

6. **CPP Module 05**:
   - **Description**: Introduces exception handling in C++, including the mechanisms for throwing and catching exceptions and best practices for robust error management.

7. **CPP Module 06**:
   - **Description**: Focuses on C++ casts, particularly the differences and appropriate use cases for `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.

8. **CPP Module 07**:
   - **Description**: Covers templates in C++, including function and class templates, and their applications for generic programming.

9. **CPP Module 08**:
   - **Description**: Discusses templated containers, iterators, algorithms, and the principles of the Standard Template Library (STL).
